I manage and mentor a team of 5 data scientists, fostering their technical growth and career development through structured coaching and hands-on guidance. My leadership contributed to our platform deploying 200+ machine learning models and achieving an 85% reduction in manual review work while maintaining over 99% accuracy. I architect end-to-end fraud prevention solutions, from real-time detection systems processing millions of transactions daily to sophisticated anomaly detection algorithms. Through strategic partnerships with product, engineering, and business teams, I helped launch AWS's Generative AI fraud detection capabilities, which reduced fraud incidents by 92% across our client portfolio. I balance deep technical involvement with people management - implementing mentorship programs, establishing cross-functional collaboration frameworks, and building high-performing teams that improved our deployment velocity by 40%.","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/"},{"name":"Amazon Web Services (AWS)","description":"Data Scientist, AWS Fraud Prevention - May 2021 - April 2023\n\nDuring my tenure as a Data Scientist at AWS, I was involved in building the foundation of our fraud prevention platform. I designed and implemented machine learning models using deep neural networks and transformers to detect fraud patterns across multiple payment channels. I developed a real-time anomaly detection system that processes over 10 million transactions per day with sub-100ms latency. I collaborated closely with product teams to translate ML concepts into business value, contributing to $15M in annual savings for our enterprise clients. My work on feature engineering and model optimization contributed to achieving 97% fraud detection accuracy while reducing false positives by 60%. I also worked on establishing MLOps best practices, implementing CI/CD pipelines for model deployment that reduced our time-to-production from weeks to days.","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/"},{"name":"Fidelity Investments","description":"Senior Manager, Data Science - January 2018 - April 2021\n\nAt Fidelity, I led the transformation of risk management practices for a $32 billion investment portfolio through advanced analytics and machine learning. I built and managed a team of 5 data scientists, where I established a data-driven culture that fundamentally changed how we approached investment risk assessment. My team developed a comprehensive risk management platform that reduced false positives by 65% while ensuring full regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions. I pioneered the use of alternative data sources and advanced statistical modeling techniques, creating predictive models that improved our risk-adjusted returns by 18%. A significant part of my role involved stakeholder management - I regularly presented complex analytical findings to C-level executives and regulatory bodies, translating technical insights into actionable business strategies. I also implemented a robust model governance framework that became the template for other business units across Fidelity.","link":"https://www.fidelity.com/"},{"name":"Fidelity Investments","description":"Manager, Analytics & Insights - January 2016 - December 2017\n\nThis role marked my transition into leadership, where I managed a team of 5 analysts focused on generating insights from Fidelity's customer and market data. I led the development of customer segmentation models that improved our marketing campaign effectiveness by 35% and increased customer lifetime value by 22%. My team built predictive analytics capabilities that helped identify at-risk customers, resulting in a 28% improvement in retention rates. I established standardized reporting frameworks and implemented automated dashboard solutions using Tableau and Python, which reduced manual reporting time by 70% and improved data accuracy across business units. During this period, I initiated Fidelity's first machine learning pilot projects, laying the groundwork for the analytics capabilities I would later build as Senior Manager. I mentored junior analysts, with 4 out of 5 team members receiving promotions during my tenure.","link":"https://www.fidelity.com/"}],"skills":[{"name":"Machine Learning & AI","description":"Deep Neural Networks, Transformers, LLMs (GPT, BERT), Anomaly Detection, Time Series Analysis"},{"name":"MLOps & Infrastructure","description":"MLflow, Kubeflow, SageMaker, CI/CD for ML, A/B Testing, Model Monitoring, Docker, Kubernetes"},{"name":"Programming & Cloud","description":"Python, R, SQL, PySpark, AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, EMR), Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, Airflow"},{"name":"Leadership & Strategy","description":"Team Development, Technical Mentorship, Performance Management, Strategic Planning, Resource Allocation"}]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
