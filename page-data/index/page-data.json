We have deployed 200+ machine learning models achieving 85% reduction in manual processes with 99% accuracy. I lead AWS account compromise detection strategy for generative AI services, where we have decreased fraud events by 92%. I balance technical leadership with people management, implementing mentorship programs and cross-functional frameworks that improved deployment velocity by 40%.","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/"},{"name":"Amazon Web Services (AWS)","description":"Data Scientist, AWS Fraud Prevention | May 2021 - April 2023\n\nI contributed to building the real time AWS account compromise prevention platform, designing ML models using deep neural networks and transformers to detect fraud patterns across AWS services. I developed a real-time classifier processing 1.1 million events per second with sub-100ms latency. My work contributed to $15M in annual cost savings for AWS, achieving 97% fraud detection accuracy while reducing false positives by 60%. I established MLOps best practices and CI/CD pipelines that reduced deployment time from weeks to days.","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/"},{"name":"Fidelity Investments","description":"Senior Manager, Data Science | January 2018 - April 2021\n\nI led risk management transformation for a $32 billion investment portfolio while building and managing a team of 5 data scientists. My team developed a comprehensive risk management platform that reduced false positives by 65% while ensuring regulatory compliance. I pioneered alternative data sources and advanced modeling techniques that improved risk-adjusted returns by 18%. I presented analytical findings to C-level executives and regulatory bodies, then implemented a model governance framework that was adopted across other business units.","link":"https://www.fidelity.com/"},{"name":"Fidelity Investments","description":"Manager, Analytics & Insights | January 2016 - December 2017\n\nI managed a team of 5 analysts generating insights from Fidelity's investment and risk data. I led development of risk assessment models and portfolio analytics that improved risk-adjusted returns and enhanced investment decision-making processes. My team built predictive analytics for risk management and portfolio optimization. I established automated reporting frameworks using Tableau and Python, which reduced manual processes by 70%. I initiated Fidelity's first machine learning pilot projects in risk management.","link":"https://www.fidelity.com/"}],"education":[{"name":"New York University, Leonard N.
